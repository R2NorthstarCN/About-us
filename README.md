# Intro
First of all, Me and my team want to express the depth of my gratitude to the R2Northstar organization. With out you guys working hard on this game over the years, this project will never exist. Also, huge thanks to Respawn entertainment for creating such a wonderful game in the first place.
# Who are we
We are a bunch of players from China, who are willing to run our own custom servers and creating mods to share with around the world. 
# Purposes of this organization
Under this Organization we will share all the translations we made to the original R2Northstar and some part of Titanfall2 itself. as well as all the Mods we have made over the years and maintaining new Mods repositories. This may include: custom skins, gamemodes, various minor Mods and a portal to R2NorthstarCN official servers.
